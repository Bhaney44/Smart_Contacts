This is a mechanism to upload and download files to and from the Algorand blockchain.

Important note: 
As it is known that Algorand blockchain is a permissionless, public blockchain,
it is determined that all data in the blockchain are accessible by any user. Thus,
kindly use this program at your own discretion. Uploading sensitive or private
data is highly discouraged. 

A sample file is included in this folder for testing and demonstration 
purposes. Any kind of file can be uploaded to the blockchain (e.g. .mp3, .pdf, .docx, 
.html, .mp4, etc.) but consider that larger files may take a significant amount of time 
to upload. Even so, an error may be encountered when uploading larger files (>6mb) in size.

An example script (example.py) is provided to demonstrate upload and download functions.
