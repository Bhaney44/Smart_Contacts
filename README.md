# Smart Contacts
This Repository is dedicated to code for Alogrand Smart Contracts using Choice Coin. Read Docs for how to implement Algogenous Smart Contracts for your own applications. Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute, transferring cryptocurrency between parties.  In other words, smart contracts are logically executed on a blockchain to transfer assets without only computational or formalized oversight.  Algorand Smart Contracts (ASCs) allow for global payments and financial transactions, with instantaneous processing and only marginal fees – less than $0.01 in total value. As typically described the three types of ASCs are: (1) Stateful Smart Contracts; (2) Stateless Smart Contracts; and (3) Algogeneous Smart Contracts.

# Stateful
Stateful refers to the contract’s ability to store information in a specific state on the network. For example, one type of stateful smart contract is a request payment function, allowing a user to request payment from another user. Generally, Stateful Smart Contracts are logical programs which store data on the blockchain.

# Stateless
Stateless Smart Contracts differ in that they validate transactions between parties, like an escrow and more like a contract in the traditional sense. Stateless Smart Contracts on the Algorand Network also act as signature delegators,  signing transactions, thus validating them on the main blockchain network. By analogy, many describe Stateless Smart Contracts as essentially equivalent to escrow functions.  Indeed, the essential design purpose for Stateless Smart Contracts were to approve or deny blockchain transactions.

# Algogeneous
Representing a technical convergence of Stateless and Stateful Smart Contracts, Algogeneous Smart Contracts include an innovative integration with artificial intelligence. Where previous ASCs must be stateful or stateless, Algogeneous contracts may be stateful, stateless, or both.
